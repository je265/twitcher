# üö® Railway Deployment Fix

## üîß **Current Issue Fixed:**

The build was failing because:
- Railway was trying to use Docker instead of NIXPACKS
- Docker build context was incorrect for the monorepo structure
- Missing files in the build context

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied:**

1. **Removed .dockerignore** - This was interfering with Railway's build system
2. **Updated Railway Configuration** - Root level now handles the build
3. **Simplified App Configurations** - Individual apps no longer need complex build commands

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

### **1. Update Railway Service Configuration:**

In your Railway dashboard, for both services:

- **Web App Service**: Change Root Directory from `/apps/web` to `/` (root)
- **Worker Service**: Change Root Directory from `/apps/python-worker` to `/` (root)

### **2. Verify Railway Configuration:**

Your root `railway.json` should now look like this:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "pnpm install && pnpm --filter web build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "startCommand": "cd apps/web && pnpm start"
  }
}
```

### **3. Commit and Push Changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway configuration: use NIXPACKS instead of Docker"
git push
```

### **4. Redeploy:**

```bash
# From the root directory
railway up
```

## üîë **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Root Directory**: Both services now deploy from `/` (root) instead of individual app directories
2. **Build System**: Using NIXPACKS instead of Docker for better monorepo support
3. **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm --filter web build` runs from root
4. **Start Command**: `cd apps/web && pnpm start` navigates to the correct app directory

## üìÅ **Files Updated:**

- `railway.json` - Root configuration with build and start commands
- `apps/web/railway.json` - Simplified web app configuration
- `apps/python-worker/railway.json` - Simplified worker configuration
- `.railwayignore` - Excludes Docker files and unnecessary files
- **Removed**: `.dockerignore` (was interfering with Railway build)

## üéØ **Why This Fixes the Issue:**

- **No More Docker**: Railway now uses NIXPACKS builder which handles monorepos better
- **Correct Build Context**: Root directory gives access to all workspace files
- **Proper Commands**: Build runs from root, start runs from app directory
- **Clean Environment**: No Docker files to confuse Railway's build system

## üö® **Important Notes:**

- **Root Directory**: Must be `/` (root) for both services
- **Build Command**: Runs from root directory with pnpm workspace filters
- **Start Command**: Navigates to the correct app directory before starting
- **Environment Variables**: Still need to be set in Railway dashboard
